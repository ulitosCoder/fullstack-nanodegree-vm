#Udacity's Web developer full stack Project 2
================================================

   This project helps to manage a simple tournament in the Swiss system
where every  player gets to play in every round. 

#Install
---------


To properly use the tourname.py module these pre-requisites must be met.
1. PostgreSQL 9.3.11 installed
2. psycopg2 module installed
3. Before starting the test, run the tournamet.sql script


To run this code there are, essentially, two options

1. Install the vagrant VM package (the easiest way)
Or
2. Install the prerequisites for running the code.

----------------------------------------------------

1. Running the code with Vagrant




NOTE: The easiest way to test this code is to instal VirtualBox and Vagrant.
Then navigate on your console to the directory containing this file and execute:
	$vagarant up 

then 
	$vagrant ssh

The predefined virtual machine already has the necessary requirements for this 
code to run.
